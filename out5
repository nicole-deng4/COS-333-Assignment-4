Title	Advanced C%Science Programming Techniques
Description	This is a course about the practice of programming. Programming is more than just writing code. Programmers must also assess tradeoffs, choose among design alternatives, debug and test, improve performance, and maintain software written by themselves & others. At the same time, they must be concerned with compatibility, robustness, and reliability, while meeting specifications. Students will have the opportunity to develop these skills by working on their own code and in group projects.

Title	Race, Drugs, and Drug Policy in America
Description	From "Chinese opium" to Oxycontin, and from cocaine and "Crack" to BiDil, drug controversies reflect enduring debates about the role of medicine, the law, the policing of ethnic identity, and racial difference. This course explores the history of controversial substances (prescription medicines, over-the-counter products, black market substances, psychoactive drugs), and how, from cigarettes to alcohol and opium, these substances become vehicles for heated debates over immigration, identity, cultural and biological difference, criminal character, the line between legality and illegality, and the boundaries of the normal and the pathological.

Title	At Home in New Jersey
Description	This team-taught seminar is designed as a capstone course for AMS concentrators and offers an opportunity to work at a more sophisticated and advanced level. Taking New Jersey as our object of study, we will reflect on the ways various residents (and visitors) have constructed worlds--spatial worlds as well as worlds of meaning--in and on this particular ground. We will examine both how we live today and the multiple ways that "how we live today" must be situated within longer histories, including such topics as property rights, suburbanization, zoning, transportation, home and homelessness, immigration, environment and community.

Title	Anthropology of Mental Illness
Description	We adopt a comparative, historical, and cultural approach to mental health, and its accompanying illnesses, remedies, and institutions. Especially important will be the creation of cultural consensus surrounding categories of normal and pathological in mental health, and their subsequent codification in diagnoses, treatments, and institutions. We'll examine psychoanalytic theory, American psychiatry, and debates that call the very premise of disordered health and "madness" into question. We'll also focus on ethnographic accounts of mental illnesses: depression, schizophrenia, anxiety, and the global rise of pharmaceuticals treatments.

Title	History of Anthropological Theory
Description	This course is an introduction to fundamental theories and debates in social/cultural anthropology. We will examine the national and colonial origins of anthropology, considering how western encounters with non-western peoples in the 19th-20th centuries opened questions about human kinship, history, economy, religion, language, sexuality, and personhood that continue to shape the horizons of our thought today. We will study this inheritance critically, exploring the changing concepts, methods, and ethics of anthropological research and writing, and evaluate their bearing on questions of power, justice, and identity in the present.
Prerequisites	ANT 201 or instructor's permission. Non-majors will also need instructor's permission to enroll.

Title	Music from the Hispanophone Caribbean
Description	This interdisciplinary seminar utilizes the musical cultures of Puerto Rico, the Dominican Republic, and Cuba to reflect upon the aesthetic, migratory, and social histories of the Hispanophone Caribbean. Students will listen to the sounded legacies of conquest, slavery, colonialism, and U.S. intervention and occupation. The effects of transnational migration on music's performance and reception will also be one of the key themes in the course. We will not only consider the creative traditions and receptive worlds embedded in musical recordings, but will also pay attention to music's traces in literature, film, and other ephemera.

Title	The Black Melting Pot: Interrogating Race, Difference, and Identity
Description	As the demographics of Blacks in America change, we are compelled to rethink the dominant stories of who African Americans are, and from whence they come. In this seminar, we will explore the deep cultural, genealogical, national origin, regional, and class-based diversity of people of African descent in the United States. Materials for the course will include scholarly writings as well as memoirs and fiction. In addition to reading assignments, students will be expected to complete an ethnographic or oral history project based upon research conducted within a Black community in the U.S., and a music or visual art based presentation of work.

Title	Josephine Baker and the Modern
Description	What does a black burlesque star have to do with the making of Euro-American modernity? This course situates the performance art of Josephine Baker as a dynamic fulcrum through which to trace the unexpected connections between the invention of what might be called a "modernist style" and the staging of black skin at the turn of the 20th century. We will study her work in film, photography, and cinema as an active and profound engagement with a range of modernist innovations and theories in the fields of film, photography, architecture, art, and literature.

Title	Local Governance and Development in Africa
Description	Decentralization is widely advocated as a means of enhancing the quality of governance, improving the quality of service delivery, and achieving a variety of related socio-economic development objectives. However, reforms across Africa have often failed to achieve the desired objectives. The course seeks to explain this paradox and to explore the multiple forms of local governance in Africa. We will analyze empirical examples from across the African continent as well as case studies from other regions for comparative perspective, to assess the potential of decentralization reforms and community-driven development projects to improve outcomes.

Title	The Computational Universe
Description	Computers have brought the world to our fingertips. We will try to understand at a basic level the science--old and new--underlying this new Computational Universe. Our quest takes us on a broad sweep of scientific knowledge and related technologies: propositional logic of the ancient Greeks (microprocessors); quantum mechanics (silicon chips); network and system phenomena (internet and search engines); computational intractability (secure encryption); and efficient algorithms (genomic sequencing). Ultimately, this study makes us look anew at ourselves--our genome; language; music; "knowledge"; and, above all, the mystery of our intelligence.
Prerequisites	None. This course is geared towards non-CS concentrators, including social science and humanities majors. Students who have take COS 126 or any higher course in the Computer Science should not take this course.

Title	Children's Literature
Description	A survey of classic texts written for children from the past 200 years in (primarily) England and America. We will examine the development and range of the genre from early alphabet books to recent young adult fiction. We will try to put ourselves in the position of young readers while also studying the works as adult interpreters, asking such question as: How do stories written for children reflect and shape the lives of their readers? What can children's literature tell us about the history of reading, or of growing up, or of the imagination itself? In the process we will consider psychological and social questions as well as literary ones.
